üîç I'm a dedicated MSCS student at Arizona State University and a seasoned software developer with a passion for leveraging technology to solve complex problems. Specializing in Java, Spring, Python, ML, and diffusion models, I aim to build scalable and robust software solutions.

### What I Do
- üíª **Software Development**: Developing high-quality, scalable software applications.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Solutions**: Utilizing Azure, AWS, Vercel for optimized application deployment and management.
- üîÑ **Data Visualization and AI**: Working on projects that transform data into actionable insights using AI.
- üåê **Continuous Learning**: Always expanding my skills, currently diving deeper into AI and cloud technologies.

### My Projects
Here are some projects I've passionately worked on:
1. **St. Himark Resilience Hub: Earthquake Response & Recovery Tracker**: The "St. Himark Resilience Hub" is a web application developed to enhance situational awareness and aid in the disaster response following a significant earthquake in St. Himark. Leveraging crowdsourced data, the application aims to provide a real-time overview of the affected areas, prioritize emergency responses, and facilitate efficient resource allocation. For a working web app, visit: [St. Himark Resilience Hub](https://earthquake-damage-report.vercel.app/).
2. **ASL Gesture Recognition Platform**: Developing a TensorFlow-based model with Google's MediaPipe for precise ASL gesture recognition, promoting inclusivity in digital communication.
3. **Hand Gesture Machine Learning Analysis**: Building and evaluating machine learning models for hand gesture recognition, aimed at improving user interface inputs.
4. **Stock Trading Platform**: A comprehensive application for modern stock trading, blending user interaction with administrative management. Built on Java Spring Boot and MySQL, this platform supports functionalities including account creation, stock trading, and financial transactions, facilitated through a ReactJS-based interface for an intuitive user experience. It demonstrates my ability to create scalable, real-time responsive applications for the financial market.
